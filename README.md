# CppPlayground
This project is my playground for trying random things in C++.
As such there is no single functionality, no fully coherent structure and any
only sparse testing.
The code is written is C++20 and at the time of writing, I could only get it to
work with Clang, but not with GCC.
Feel free to grab any of the code if it sparks your interest, but make sure to
test it yourself before using it in any particular project.
To this end, the code in this repository is licensed under the MIT license.
